    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>We are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines the manner in which our mobile application (“App”) collects, uses, and shares your information when you interact with our services.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect two types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We may collect personally identifiable information only when voluntarily provided by you through forms, registrations, or any direct interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> Non-personally identifiable information such as usage data, device type, IP address, and app performance metrics are collected automatically to enhance our services.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>YouTube API:</strong> We use embedded YouTube videos for music playback. The app does not host, store, or redistribute any YouTube content. All video playback is performed through YouTube’s official embedding tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Spotify API:</strong> We access Spotify’s public API to retrieve metadata (e.g., album art, song titles, and artist information). No Spotify content is streamed directly, and we adhere to Spotify’s API guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>SoundCloud API:</strong> The app integrates with SoundCloud’s API to stream tracks in compliance with SoundCloud’s terms and policies.</li>
        </ul>
